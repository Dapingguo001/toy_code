This code base contains implementation of following papers:
1. Consensus Filters for Sensor Networks and Distributed Sensor Fusion
2. Distributed Kalman Filter with Embedded Consensus Filters
3. Distributed Kalman Filtering for Sensor Networks
4. Kalman-Consensus Filter : Optimality, Stability, and Performance

Basically just distributed kalman filter. 
I think the work here can be extend to more multi agent perception problems

First step is to reproduce the work
